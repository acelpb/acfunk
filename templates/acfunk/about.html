                <strong>I'm a Belgo-German artist that grew up in the meeting place of the borders of Belgium, Germany
                    and the Netherlands, also known as the Three-Country Point. I studied German and Russian Literature,
                    Philosophy and Art at the Free University of Brussels where I currently live and work.
                    Anne-Christine Funk is a Belgo-German artist who grew up in the meeting place of the borders of
                    Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, known as the Three-Country Point. She studied German and
                    Russian literature, philosophy and art at the Free University of Brussels where she currently lives
                    and works.</strong>

            <p>I discovered the Art of Drawing with Oil-pastels at a very early age and still use them almost
                exclusively today. They are a unique medium for creating colorful paintings and can be used for precise
                definitition when it comes to geometric shaping.</p>
            <p>I started during my studies exploring in an symbolic way literary pieces and philosophical concepts such
                as Hermann Hesse’s « Steppenwolf » or Fink’s « Fensterhaftigkeit ». Through the precise rendering of
                geometric shapes combined with bright colors I intended to catch theoretical and complex thoughts into
                colorful pieces of art that would intrigue the spectator and thus bring him closer to what’s so often
                invisible and hidden in books.</p>
            <p>By extending abstract thoughts into paintings I have recently come to study another form of abstraction :
                the concept of loneliness in our modern society. Living in a big city has brought me to depict places
                and buildings that are crowded and surrounded by people passing by, individuals that are overly
                interconnected through the internet and social media but yet are visibly lonely, « Zwischenräume » as
                defined by Peter Handke where we feel connected but still are complete strangers to each other. The aim
                is not to find artistic beauty in loneliness but to intercept that modern loneliness surrounding us in
                order to provide a different perspective on who we are and where we live.</p>
