                <strong>Anne-Christine Funk is a Belgo-German artist who grew up in the meeting place of the borders of
                    Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, known as the Three-Country Point. She studied German and
                    Russian
                    literature, philosophy and art at the Free University of Brussels where she currently lives and
                    works.</strong>

            <p>
                Her pastel art is an exploration of her world of thoughts reflecting in an abstract and symbolic way
                literary myth and modern landscapes.

            <p>
                Her more recent work has been studying the architectural beauty of Brussels streets, parcs and
                landscapes.
                The cityâ€™s architecture inspires her work to find artistry and harmony by transforming the urban
                landscapes
                into the expression of her dreams.

            </p>

            <p>
                Her art is not a mimetic representation of the visible world but a subjective interpretation of it: the
                abstract rendering of geometric shapes combined with a surrealistic dimension expand the perceptible
                limits
                of nature and it surroundings. The assemblage of different kind of shapes cover and surround at the time
                the
                image they are catching.

            </p>
            <p>
                Through her world of thoughts she defines in her paintings both the visible and the invisible in order
                to
                depict the beauty lying beneath the curtain of semblance.
